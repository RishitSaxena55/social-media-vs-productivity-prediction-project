# 📱 Social Media vs Productivity 📊

This project explores the impact of **social media usage on individual productivity** using data-driven analysis and machine learning techniques.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

In today’s hyper-connected world, social media platforms play a major role in our daily routines. While they offer entertainment, information, and connection, they can also be a significant source of distraction. The goal of this project is to:

- Analyze how different aspects of social media usage affect productivity.
- Identify correlations between user habits and self-reported productivity scores.
- Build machine learning models to predict productivity based on social media behavior and digital well-being factors.

## 📂 Dataset Information

The dataset includes responses from individuals about their daily social media usage and productivity. It contains both numerical and categorical features.

### Key Features:

| Feature Name                      | Description |

| `age`                            | Age of the individual |
| `gender`                         | Gender of the individual |
| `job_type`                       | Employment type (e.g., student, freelancer, full-time) |
| `daily_social_media_time`       | Time spent on social media daily (in hours) |
| `social_media_preference`       | Platform of preference (e.g., Instagram, LinkedIn) |
| `uses_focus_apps`               | Whether the individual uses focus/anti-distraction apps |
| `has_digital_wellbeing_enabled` | Whether digital wellbeing tools are enabled |
| `actual_productivity_score`     | Self-reported productivity score (0-100) |
